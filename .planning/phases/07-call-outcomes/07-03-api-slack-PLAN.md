<objective>
Build the decision surfaces for Call Outcomes outside the dashboard: the `PATCH /api/call-outcomes/[id]` endpoint (the single resolve path used by every UI), the Slack interactivity branch (consuming the buildCallOutcomeBlocks/buildCallOutcomeResolvedBlocks builders created in 07-01), and the `chat.update` sync that retires Slack buttons when an outcome is chosen on any surface.

Purpose: Lets a coach resolve a call from Slack or via the dashboard/lead-profile (which both POST to this API), atomically and idempotently, with Slack kept in sync.
Output: `app/api/call-outcomes/[id]/route.ts`, `lib/slack/sync-call-outcome-message.ts`, and the `call_outcome_*` branch in slack interactivity (the Block Kit builders are imported from 07-01's slack/blocks.ts).

From 07-01: recordCallOutcomeAtomic(id, outcome, actor) in apps/web/lib/call-outcomes/record-atomic.ts
  -> { ok, reason, new_status }; outcome ∈ 'no_show'|'completed'|'converted'.
  call_outcomes row has coach_id, lead_id, status, outcome, notes.
From 07-02 (sibling wave-2; may land before/after): fireCallOutcomeDownstream({outcome,coachId,leadId,callOutcomeId})
  in apps/web/lib/call-outcomes/downstream.ts. If not yet present when this lands,
  import it and let typecheck drive ordering; do NOT inline-duplicate the downstream logic.

From apps/web/app/api/drafts/[id]/route.ts (the exact template):
  PATCH: createClient() -> auth.getUser() (401 if none) -> Zod safeParse (400) ->
  adminClient.from("drafts").select(coach_id,...).eq("id",id).maybeSingle() ->
  404 if missing, 403 if draft.coach_id !== user.id ->
  approveDraftAtomic(id,"dashboard") -> 409 {ok:false,reason} if !ok ->
  inngest.send(...) -> syncSlackDraftMessage(...) -> 200 {ok:true,new_status}.

From apps/web/lib/slack/blocks.ts: buildDraftReadyBlocks returns Block Kit array;
  buttons carry { value: draftId, action_id: "draft_approve"|"draft_edit"|"draft_hold" }.
  buildCallOutcomeBlocks + buildCallOutcomeResolvedBlocks ALREADY EXIST here (created in 07-01) —
  import them; the call_outcome_* action_ids are the contract this plan's interactivity branch keys on.
From apps/web/app/api/webhooks/slack/interactivity/route.ts:
  verifySlackSignature({...}) already runs; findCoachIdByTeam(payload.user.team_id);
  branches keyed on action.action_id === "draft_approve" etc.; action.value carries the id.
From apps/web/lib/slack/sync-draft-message.ts: reads notification_log.external_id (the ts)
  for the message, then chat.update to retire buttons.

  <name>Task 2: Confirm the Block Kit builders (from 07-01) match D-18 button copy/action_ids</name>
  <read_first>

  </read_first>
  <action>
    The Block Kit builders already exist (07-01 created buildCallOutcomeBlocks + buildCallOutcomeResolvedBlocks in apps/web/lib/slack/blocks.ts). Do NOT re-create them. This task only reconciles them with D-18:
    - Confirm buildCallOutcomeBlocks emits exactly three buttons with action_ids `call_outcome_no_show`, `call_outcome_completed`, `call_outcome_converted`, each `value` = callOutcomeId, header "How did the call with {leadName} go?" + a callTime context line. If 07-01's copy drifts from the exact D-18 requirement, adjust the text/style ONLY (do not change the action_ids — the interactivity branch in Task 3 + the dispatcher in 07-02 depend on them).
    - Confirm buildCallOutcomeResolvedBlocks(outcome) renders a buttonless "✅ Recorded: {label}" state used by syncSlackCallOutcomeMessage (Task 3).
    - If both already satisfy D-18, this task is a no-op verification (no file edit) — record that in the SUMMARY. The grep acceptance below treats blocks.ts as an imported dependency, not a file this plan creates.

    Create apps/web/lib/slack/sync-call-outcome-message.ts: `syncSlackCallOutcomeMessage({ id, coachId, outcome })` — mirror syncSlackDraftMessage: look up notification_log.external_id (the Slack ts) for the call_outcome_pending message for this id; if none, return (never notified). Resolve the Slack bot token, then `chat.update` the message channel+ts with buildCallOutcomeResolvedBlocks(outcome) to retire the buttons. Swallow errors (stale button tolerated), no PII in logs.

    Extend apps/web/app/api/webhooks/slack/interactivity/route.ts with a branch:
    - After the existing signature verify + findCoachIdByTeam, when `action.action_id.startsWith("call_outcome_")`:
      * map action_id → outcome: call_outcome_no_show→'no_show', call_outcome_completed→'completed', call_outcome_converted→'converted'.
      * callOutcomeId = action.value.
      * **Verify ownership**: load call_outcomes row by id via adminClient; confirm row.coach_id === the coach resolved from team_id (no cross-team spoof). If mismatch, 200 ack with no action (do not resolve).
      * result = recordCallOutcomeAtomic(callOutcomeId, outcome, "slack"). On ok: write the timeline lead_event (same mapping as the API), fireCallOutcomeDownstream({...}), then syncSlackCallOutcomeMessage to retire buttons. On !ok (already resolved): still chat.update to retire (idempotent UX).

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| coach browser → PATCH /api/call-outcomes/[id] | Authenticated but must enforce ownership (no IDOR) |
| Slack → /api/webhooks/slack/interactivity | Untrusted POST; signature + team→coach mapping required |
| handlers → record_call_outcome_atomic (service role) | Atomic CAS prevents double-resolve / races |

## STRIDE Threat Register

| Threat ID | Category | Component | Disposition | Mitigation Plan |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| T-07-13 | Elevation/IDOR | PATCH resolves another coach's outcome | mitigate | 403 when row.coach_id !== user.id; row fetched before any mutation |
| T-07-14 | Spoofing | forged Slack interactivity POST | mitigate | verifySlackSignature (existing) runs first; reject on invalid |
| T-07-15 | Elevation | Slack click resolves an outcome from a foreign team | mitigate | findCoachIdByTeam(team_id) + verify row.coach_id === that coach before resolve |
| T-07-16 | Tampering | double-click / late provider no_show double-resolves | mitigate | record_call_outcome_atomic CAS on status='awaiting_outcome'; second call no-ops (409) |
| T-07-17 | Tampering | unvalidated outcome/notes body | mitigate | Zod z.enum outcome + notes max length at the boundary |
| T-07-18 | Info disclosure | lead PII in API/Slack logs | accept→mitigate | IDs only in logs; no lead name/email (CALL-016) |
